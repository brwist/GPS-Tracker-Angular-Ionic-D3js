    <h5>WiFi Tracking (Default)</h5>

    <p>
      While motion is detected, Trakkit checks for WiFi every 2 minutes.
      <br>
      If an open WiFi is found, Trakkit records and shows its WiFi position (<span class="blue">blue</span> dots).
      <br>
      This is the estimated position based on the location of the WiFi source. GPS is not used.
      <br>
      Typical battery life is 2 months.
    </p>

    <h5>GPS Tracking</h5>

    <p>
      Trakkit checks for WiFi every 2 minutes.
      <br>
      If an open WiFi is found, Trakkit records and shows its GPS position (<span class="red">red</span> dots).
      <br>
      If Trakkit cannot get a GPS position (it is cloudy, rainy, etc) then it resolves on an estimated position based on
      the location of the WiFi source (<span class="blue">blue</span> dots).
      <br>
      Typical battery life less than a month.
    </p>

    <h5>GPS Logging</h5>

    <p>
      Logs Trakkitâ€™s GPS position every minute, while moving.
      <br>
      When Trakkit senses no motion, it checks for WiFi and if it finds one it will try to check in
      (you'll see a <span class="red">red</span> dot if position is GPS based or <span class="blue">blue</span>
      dot if position is WiFi based).
      <br>
      When you reach a Home WiFi, previously configured, Trakkit uploads all its GPS Logging data
      (<span class="black">black</span> dots).
      <br>
      Logging Data includes: Time, Location, Speed, Heading, Motion Level, and Temperature
      <br>
      Typical battery life is 2 months.
    </p>

      to change or Edit any of your settings.
